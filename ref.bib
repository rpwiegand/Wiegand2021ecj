STAGE learns an evaluation function which predicts the outcome of a local search algorithm, such as hillclimbing or WALKSAT, as a function of state features along its search trajectories. The learned evaluation function is used to bias future search trajectories toward better optima. We present positive results on six large-scale optimization domains.},
